dvd_info - a set of utilities for accessing DVDs

Includes:

* dvd_info - display information about a DVD in human-readable or JSON output,
	disc title, disc ID, disc chapters in OGM container format

* dvd_copy - copy a DVD title to the filesystem

* dvd_drive_status - display drive status: open, closed, closed with disc,
	or polling

Requirements:

* libdvdread >= 4.2.1 (libdvdcss required for decryption)

Homepage:

  * http://dvds.beandog.org/doku.php?id=dvd_info

Development:

The git repo on github is *NOT* intended to build from a straight pull. There
are programs I'm working on that are not in the Makefile.am yet (or there are
more than are in the repo). You can, of course, try to build it, but I don't
target releases here.

Version 1.0 released on 2018-02-19

* https://sourceforge.net/projects/dvdinfo/files/

Sources:

The source can be either a device name, a single file, or a directory. The
program will the default blu-ray drive if no path is given.

  $ dvd_info
  $ dvd_info /dev/sr0
  $ dvd_info ~/Media/DVD.ADVENTURE.iso
  $ dvd_info ~/Media/DVD.ADVENTURE/
  $ dvd_info /mnt/dvd

If you're going to do a lot of reads on a disc drive, I'd recommend mounting it
so the access can be cached -- this is especially helpful when using / testing
bluray_copy a lot to get chapters, titles, playlists, etc.

  # mount /dev/sr0 -o ro -t udf /mnt/dvd

Depending on your luck / region / disc drive / disc / local alien invasion, you
may or may not be able to make an ISO directly from a disc.

If you want to give it a whirl, I recommend ddrescue:

  $ ddrescue -b 2048 -n /dev/sr0 dvd.iso ddrescue.log

dvd_info:

Usage: dvd_info [options] [-t track number] [dvd path]

Options:
  -t, --track #		Limit to one track number (default: longest)

Detailed information:
  -a, --audio		audio streams
  -v, --video		video
  -c, --chapters	chapters
  -s, --subtitles	subtitles
  -d, --cells		cells
  -x, --all		display all

Formatting:
  -j, --json		Display output in JSON format
  -o, --ogm		Display OGM chapter format for track (default: longest)
  -i, --id		Display DVD id only (from libdvdread)
  -T, --title		Display DVD title only (path must be device or file)

Other:
  -q, --quiet		Don't display DVD title, longest track
  -h, --help		Display these help options
  -V, --version		Version information

DVD path can be a device name, a single file, or directory.

Examples:
  dvd_info		# Read default DVD device (/dev/sr0)
  dvd_info /dev/dvd	# Read a specific DVD device
  dvd_info movie.iso	# Read an image file
  dvd_info ~/movie/	# Read a directory that contains VIDEO_TS

The syntax and output was designed to closely resemble the awesome program
"lsdvd." The OGM chapter format matches "dvdxchap" from the ogmtools package.

dvd_copy:

Usage: dvd_copy [-t track] [-c chapter[-chapter]] [-o filename] [dvd path]

DVD path can be a device name, a single file, or directory.

Examples:
  dvd_copy		# Read default DVD device (/dev/sr0)
  dvd_copy /dev/dvd	# Read a specific DVD device
  dvd_copy movie.iso	# Read an image file
  dvd_copy ~/movie/	# Read a directory that contains VIDEO_TS

If no output file is specified, it will save to a format of "track_XX.vob".

If no track is selected, dvd_copy will simply select the longest track.

Portability:

Runs on GNU/Linux, OpenBSD, and NetBSD. See its DVD wiki page for specific
OS instructions: http://dvds.beandog.org/doku.php?id=dvd_info

I take a minimalist approach to my code, and so there is only the minimum
of required autotools content in the repo: configure.ac and Makefile.am
This allows the user to build the config files on their system. Run
"autoreconf -fi" and you'll have the familiar configure, make, make install
setup.

Other stuff:

I don't have my own tool to copy the entire DVD file structure to the
filesystem, simply because I don't really need one. I use dvdbackup, and that's
what I'd recommend. See http://dvdbackup.sourceforge.net/

Support:

I love hunting down anomalies, so if you run into something odd on a disc, let
me know and I'd love to look into it. Bug reports are good, too.

If you want to say thanks, buy me a Blu-ray disc :D There's nothing I'd love
more than a new disc to play with (and something to watch as well).
Here's my Amazon wishlist: http://a.co/ik9j9Fw if you're feeling generous!

For this project, the code is at github - https://github.com/beandog/dvd_info
However, I run releases through SourceForge - http://dvdinfo.sf.net/
