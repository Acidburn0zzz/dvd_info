.SH DVD WIDESCREEN VIDEO

Note that it's not possible using this tool alone (or dvd_json) to tell for certain if the video on a track is anamorphic or letterbox. The DVD specification allows the flags to be set manually, and that is what is shown with the "Display format" output.

This is only a problem though if the aspect ratio is 4:3 and it's padded. If it's 16:9 then chances are it's already anamorphic.

Note that this also is only really a problem when going *way* back to when the DVD format was very new, and whether a video was encoded anamorphic or not was a hot topic.

.SH DVD ACTIVE AUDIO TRACKS

Audio tracks can be marked as "active" or not inside the specification, and 
.B dvd_info
and
.B JSON
outputs will display that information.

The information is presented with the idea of ignoring the audio tracks that are not active can help you narrow down which track is a feature, or has the preferred language, etc.

.SH DVD AUDIO CODECS
The DVD specification allows for six audio codecs to be used, but the most common are Dolby Digital (ac3) and Digital Theater Sound (dts), each of which can contain up to six channels.

.SH DVD SUBTITLES
For both
.B dvd_info
and
.B JSON
outputs, subtitles and subpictures both refer to the same thing -- VOBSUB subtitles.

VOBSUBS are images that are overlaid on the picture during playback and can be detected through scanning the DVD structure.

Closed captioning streams are subtitles that are in text format. found on some DVD tracks. They are embedded in the MPEG2 program stream, and 
.B dvd_info
doesn't scan it to look for them. Other tools such as HandBrake do. ccextractor can export the subtitles directly from a local VOB file.

.SH BUGS
Lots of effort is made to work around any nasty bugs or poisoned data in the DVD metadata and structure to give accurate information, as well as to compile the code with little (to no!) compiler errors at all. Some DVDs may not be able to be read for a variety of reasons: poorly mastered disc from provider, phyiscally damaged by scratches or heat, or additional DRM methods and intentionally breaking the format specs.
